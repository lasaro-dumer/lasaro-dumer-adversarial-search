# Adversarial Search
**Adversarial search assignment**

Assignment description is [here](ai-t1b.pdf)!
Requires [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/news.html) :snake:
Tested with [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.7.6
Check out this [Python](http://learnpython.org/) tutorial!

## Getting Started
- [Download this project](https://github.com/pucrs-ai-cs/adversarial-search/archive/master.zip)
- Install Python 2.7 and Pygame with [Super Install](super-install.sh) on Linux, you may be asked to accept, press **Y**

    ```
    bash super-install.sh
    ```

### Source:
The following are the files required to build your [Tic-tac-toe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) player. Minimax and Alpha-Beta are the incomplete ones.

- [common.py](common.py) with constants and exceptions
- [util.py](util.py) with util functions
- [interface.py](interface.py) with drawing calls
- [tictactoe.py](tictactoe.py) contains the game logic
- [players](players) contains all player implementations
- [players/player_human.py](players/player_human.py) asks human for help
- [players/player_random.py](players/player_random.py) picks any clear cell
- [players/player_minimax.py](players/player_minimax.py) uses [minimax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm :exclamation:
- [players/player_alphabeta.py](players/player_alphabeta.py) uses [alpha-beta pruning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning), this one is a bonus :exclamation:
- [test_tictactoe.py](test_tictactoe.py) contains the tests for code evaluation

### Execution

Player :o: is the first to play, followed by :x:, but your players can behave differently from each other using different arguments:

| Argument  | Player Type |
| --------- | ------------- |
| human     | Human :restroom:  |
| random    | Random :interrobang: |
| minimax   | Minimax :arrow_down_small::arrow_up_small: |
| alphabeta | Alpha-Beta :rocket: |

Use ```--quiet``` flag to disable verbose output of movements during the game.

- Execute interface with default players
```
python interface.py [--quiet] [playerO playerX]
```
- Execute terminal with default players
```
python tictactoe.py [--quiet] [playerO playerX]
```
- Execute tests
```
python test_tictactoe.py
```

### Questions

Questions are in the [readme.txt](readme.txt) to be sent together with the code.

### Player Interface

Players require a minimal interface to play the game. They receive their symbol (O or X) in the initialization. Just remember to use ```self.symbol``` to compare with the other cells in the board to see how you are going. The hard part is to select the best cell in the board, ```get_next_move(self, board)``` is the method that must return a valid cell during the player turn. Cells must be an integer between 0 and 8. Let us take our friend Bob as an example. [Somebody](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob) told him to start in the center, but he never got the rest of the message to understand how to continue the game:

```Python
from player import Player

class BobPlayer(Player):

    def __init__(self, symbol):
        super(BobPlayer, self).__init__(symbol)

    def get_next_move(self, board):
        return 4
```

The board is represented by a 1D list, filled with ```None```, ```'X'``` or ```'O'```. If we consider Bob as the X player the board would be modified like this:

```Python
# 0 1 2
# 3 4 5
# 6 7 8

from common import *

player = Player_Bob('X')
board = [ None, None, None ,
          None, None, None ,
          None, None, None ]
move = player.get_next_move(board)
# check_valid_move
board[move] = X
```

### Hints

- Use the methods from util.py to help the development:
    - ```find_empty_cells(board)``` helps you see where is available to play.
    ```python
    board = [ None,  'X',  'O' ,
               'O',  'X',  'O' ,
              None, None, None ]
    find_empty_cells(board) # Returns [ 0, 6, 7, 8 ]
    ```
    - ```find_winner(board)``` helps you check if there is a winner. It returns a tuple, with the winner (```None``` for none) and the list of the winner movement.
    ```python
    board = [ None,  'X',  'O' ,
               'O',  'X',  'O' ,
              None,  'X', None ]
    winner, move_sequence = find_winner(board)
    print winner # Prints 'X'
    print move_sequence # Prints [1, 4, 7]
    ```
- Do not try to mark several cells at once, the game provides a copy of the board for you to observe and only the position returned will make any difference.
- Start with a **successor** method that generates ([yields?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do-in-python)) different scenarios for you.
- Take a look at our [random player](players/player_random.py) or the [questions](readme.txt) if you get stuck.
- Printing is a slow process. Use it just for development/debug, and remove it before handing the assignment.
- Python creates a lot of **.pyc** files if not called with **-B** flag, ```python -B script.py arguments```
